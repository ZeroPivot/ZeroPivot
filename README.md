### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[M/33, Lucerne, California, USA]

I'm Arity. Full-time Artist and Computer Scientist.

Currently got a few string manipulation projects going on, and am going to release my webcomic manager/gallery once I sanitize the code.

Specifically, I'm into Ruby and consider myself a Rubyist.

I'm currently working on two server backends using Ruby/Sinatra/Puma, it is not currently open sourced.
