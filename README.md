# I DID IT!!

## Focused Project
https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array

Particularly: https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb

Long term project to use this managed partitioned array on:

* The basic array of hashes data structure that cen flexibly store any kind of json related data
* Translating/Porting the ManagedPartitionedArray/PartitionedArray )https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array, https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb) to PYTHON. 

Long term project away from 100% ruby is porting every aspect of the array to Python - 10.5.2022 - 5:58PM


## Update 10.1.2022 - 2:25PM
ManagedPartitionedArray v1.2.8
* Fixed a bug through regression. Bug arose out of adding more code and not taking certain lines of code into account (`managed_partitioned_array.rb`)

## Update 9.27.2022 - 10:34am
* Fixed allocation bugs in partitioned array; it it now working as intended!

## Update 9.26.2022 - 3:46AM
Worked a bit to understand *.github.io and now have a website on github! It is still a WIP, but you can see it here: https://ZeroPivot.github.io
* TODO: Port my basic flat file blogging system to github.io

## Update 9.25.2022
Most of my activity in the past has been directed towards the Partitioned_Array repository, and within lib, managed_partitioned_array.rb. ðŸŒ 

# Milestone 9.25.2022
Several days back I completed a project that took me since 2011 to accomplish. That is, (https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array)partitioned_array. It is not yet fully documented but the theory of it is all there if you'd like to ðŸŒ 

At a basic level, ArrayOfHashes explains the theory of it in a full fledged ruby array that allocates up to infnity, and allows you to do things to arbitrary locations of the array. Partitioned Array is stricter and safer, and the essential data structure is an array of hashes. That is, ManagedPartitionedArray (partititioned_array repo) follows the array of hashes data structure in its internals, but with several lines of code and a change of logic, perhaps by a class inheritance, you could make  the partitioned array function however you want in terms of a data structure.ðŸŒ 

TODO: Create documentation for managed partitioned array (https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb) and the main, https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/ ðŸŒ
