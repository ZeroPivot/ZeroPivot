# I DID IT!!

## Bio & Info


I am a formally trained Computer Scientist, Software Engineer & Mathematician, as well as partially self-taught Artist--who focuses on Algorithms primarily written in the Ruby Programming Language

I am also starting a long-term game project in DragonRuby, and transitioning to becoming a full-time Indie Game Developer, doing the code and assets myself, making what music I can and buying assets to test the BashAsset engine at a more rapid pace

I work often with Server Backends, Ruby, The Linden Scripting Language, C/C++, and now, Game Development in DragonRuby

**I am now calling the partitioned array platform agnostic**

**Updated the readme file for the Managed Partitioned Array/Partitioned Array, there are bits and pieces on how to go about using it. If you need help or are curious, I'm but a DM away**


## Focused Project
https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array

Particularly: https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb

Long term project to use this managed partitioned array on:

* The basic array of hashes data structure that cen flexibly store any kind of json related data
* Translating/Porting the ManagedPartitionedArray/PartitionedArray )https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array, https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb) to PYTHON. 

Long term project away from 100% ruby is porting every aspect of the array to Python - 10.5.2022 - 5:58PM


## Update 10.1.2022 - 2:25PM
ManagedPartitionedArray v1.2.8
* Fixed a bug through regression. Bug arose out of adding more code and not taking certain lines of code into account (`managed_partitioned_array.rb`)

## Update 9.27.2022 - 10:34am
* Fixed allocation bugs in partitioned array; it it now working as intended!

## Update 9.26.2022 - 3:46AM
Worked a bit to understand *.github.io and now have a website on github! It is still a WIP, but you can see it here: https://ZeroPivot.github.io
* TODO: Port my basic flat file blogging system to github.io

## Update 9.25.2022
Most of my activity in the past has been directed towards the Partitioned_Array repository, and within lib, managed_partitioned_array.rb. 🌠

# Milestone 9.25.2022
Several days back I completed a project that took me since 2011 to accomplish. That is, (https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array)partitioned_array. It is not yet fully documented but the theory of it is all there if you'd like to 🌠

At a basic level, ArrayOfHashes explains the theory of it in a full fledged ruby array that allocates up to infnity, and allows you to do things to arbitrary locations of the array. Partitioned Array is stricter and safer, and the essential data structure is an array of hashes. That is, ManagedPartitionedArray (partititioned_array repo) follows the array of hashes data structure in its internals, but with several lines of code and a change of logic, perhaps by a class inheritance, you could make  the partitioned array function however you want in terms of a data structure.🌠

TODO: Create documentation for managed partitioned array (https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/blob/master/lib/managed_partitioned_array.rb) and the main, https://github.com/ZeroPivot/partitioned_array/ 🌠
