## Bio & Info


I am a formally trained Computer Scientist, Software Engineer & Mathematician, as well as trained Artist--who focuses on Algorithms primarily written in the Ruby Programming Language

I am also starting a long-term game project in DragonRuby, and transitioning to becoming a full-time Indie Game Developer, doing the code and assets myself, making what music I can and buying assets to test the BashAsset engine at a more rapid pace

I work often with Server Backends, Ruby, The Linden Scripting Language, C/C++, and now, Game Development in DragonRuby
